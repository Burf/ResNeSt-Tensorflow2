# ResNeSt: Split-Attention Networks

This is an implementation of "ResNeSt : Split-Attention Networks" on Keras and Tensorflow.

The implementation is based on paper[1] and [official implementation](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/ResNeSt).

## Model

- Model
  * ResNeSt-50
  * ResNeSt-101
  * ResNeSt-200
  * ResNeSt-269
- Pre-trained weight
  * Imagenet(The pre-trained weights are converted from [official weight](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/ResNeSt).)

## Requirements

- Python 3
- tensorflow 2
- torch 1.1â–² (Use the pre-trained weights)
